# Laptop-Price-Prediction
# Laptop Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Built a machine learning model to accurately predict laptop prices based on features like brand, specifications, and performance. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation.

## Key Highlights
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis to prepare the dataset.
- Model training using Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
- Achieved over **86% R² score** with Gradient Boosting, improving prediction accuracy.
- Performance metrics include MAE, RMSE, and cross-validated R² score.
- End-to-end pipeline from raw data to actionable insights.
